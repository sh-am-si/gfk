The task is a kind of explanatory analysis of provided data set attached as csv file.

The file includes some variables with information as below:

| Variable | Description |
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| *period_end_date* | date of provided record |
| *translated_when* | date of modelling |
| *if_data_corrected* | information whether record was updated |
| *prod_gr_id* | Id of product group |
| *country_id_n* | Id of a country |
| *delivery_type_id* | type of record delivery to the system |
| *freq_id* | type of regularity of delivered records |
| *retailer_id* | Id of record provider |
| *brand_id* | Id of a Brand |
| *predict_automatch* | result of model prediction 0/1 |
| *class_acctual* | actual class of predicted value 0/1 |

 

We would like you to:

- explore the data file and present information on that     assess quality of prediction

- find what features of the data are connected with poor quality of prediction

- propose ranking of criteria constraining the data to improve quality of assessment for different quality measures
- present changes in prediction quality for various scenarios of reduced data, take into consideration level of proposed data reductions
- provide a kind of summary for
    - the data
    - prediction that was made and
    - steps resulting in significantly better prediction  

 

You are allowed to process data in any way you see fit to achieve this goal.

You are free to choose any programming to complete this task.

We would like to get any code you write for this project, and would appreciate it if it was at least informally commented so that itâ€™s easier to read for us.
